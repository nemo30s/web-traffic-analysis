## Project Overview

This project analyzes web traffic patterns and user engagement on the official Brussels government website over a two-year period (2023-2024). Working with a limited dataset of 27,000 records, this analysis demonstrates how to extract meaningful insights despite data constraints.

### Key Metrics
- **19M** Total Page Views
- **14M** Active Users
- **0.74** Average Engagement Ratio
- **27K+** Data Records Analyzed

## Technologies Used

- **Python & Pandas**: Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis
- **NumPy & SciPy**: Statistical analysis and correlation calculations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Preliminary data visualization
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard development
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and documentation

## Key Findings

1. **Traffic Distribution Patterns**: The top three pages account for approximately 38% of total traffic, with language preferences heavily favoring French-language content.

2. **Engagement Analysis**: Average engagement ratio of 0.74 with significant variations by content type (webcam feeds showing exceptionally high engagement).

3. **Views vs. Active Users**: Strong correlation (0.92) between views and users with three distinct clusters of page types.

4. **Year-over-Year Analysis**: Decreasing views (-31%) alongside a smaller decrease in active users (-18%) suggests improved site efficiency.

## Key Visualizations

- **Top 10 Most Visited Pages**: Revealing strong bias toward main portal pages and French-language content
- **Views vs Active Users**: Scatter plot identifying outlier pages with high engagement
- **Top 10 Pages with Highest Engagement**: Showing webcam feeds and visual content generating substantially higher engagement
- **Year-over-Year Comparison**: Depicting shifts in the views-to-users ratio between 2023 and 2024

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Multilingual Content Enhancement**: Improve Dutch-language content accessibility and promotion
2. **Visual Content Expansion**: Incorporate more visual elements across high-traffic administrative pages
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Address responsive design issues to improve mobile engagement metrics
4. **Seasonal Content Strategy**: Develop a proactive content calendar based on identified traffic patterns
